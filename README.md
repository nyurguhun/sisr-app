# sisr-app
Drag and drop app to increase resolution of images with Single Image, Super Resolution model.

## Inna's to-do list:
* create a single page
* add drag and drop space/button. check if file has .jpg format. if not, display "we support jpg format only"
* display image that was dragged into drag-and-drop space
* display loading and then new image, next to the original image. new image can be any image, hardcoded for now.
